# Reasoning: Evaluation & Inference

A repository for evaluating and running inference on reasoning tasks using LLMs.

---

## 🚀 Progress

- **Inference backend**: ✔️ Realized  
- **Math support**: ✔️ Implemented

---

## 🗂️ TODO

### 1. Inference

- Support multiple datasets  
  - Design a high-level **registry** interface to register and manage all datasets  

### 2. Evaluation

- **Code review framework**  
- **Code judges**  
  - Research and integrate a secure sandbox environment  
  - Build or configure the sandbox  
- **Math judges**  
  - Regex-based solution checkers  
- **LLM as judge**  
  - Explore [OpenCompass](https://github.com/OpenCompass) as an example integration
