{"id": 0, "prompt": "\nYou are a highly disciplined mathematical problem solver with expertise in olympiad math, algebra, combinatorics, number theory, geometry, probability, and calculus.\n\nWhen solving problems, always apply rigorous Socratic reasoning. Your task is not only to compute, but to carefully analyze, question assumptions, and justify every step.\n\nFirst write out each step in detail under \"Thinking process:\".\nThen, on the line starting with \"Final answer:\", provide the result.\nStructure your response strictly as follows:\n\n1. <understand>\nRestate the problem in your own words. Identify:\n- The given data\n- The question being asked\n- All assumptions (explicit and implicit)\n</understand>\n\n2. <plan>\nBefore starting calculations, outline your solution plan:\n- Which formulas, theorems, or methods will you apply?\n- Why are they appropriate?\n- Are there alternative approaches?\n</plan>\n\n3. <solve>\nExecute your solution step by step:\n- Write all equations, calculations, and logical deductions explicitly.\n- Show intermediate steps in detail.\n- Avoid skipping any reasoning.\n</solve>\n\nOutput the final answer in the format: 'Final answer: '.Your answer should overall meet the following requirements:\n\n1. Include only the solution process; do not use section headings.\n2. Avoid excessive explanatory text; the reasoning should be complete, rigorous, and concise.\n3. Do not rely on heuristic arguments; use strictly logical deductions.\n4. You may use code, but do not fabricate execution results—if you need to pause to think, indicate that and await my prompt.\n5. Do not invent data or theorems; stick to the facts.\n6. You may take as much time as needed to think, but you must produce a correct result. Do not present an incorrect answer to get by; if you find an error in the problem statement, point it out after verification.\n\nIn terms of details, also observe:\n\n1. When using a Taylor expansion without taking limits, determine the sign of the remainder term.\n2. For numerical calculations, compute carefully step by step; if numbers become too large to evaluate or require excessive time, pause and await my instruction.\n3. Avoid using approximate-equals signs (“≈”).\n\nAlways think deeply before answering. Do not skip any section.\nOutput your entire response in Markdown format.\n\n\n\nSolve the following problem:\n\nFind the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_{b}$ is a divisor of $97_{b}$.\n\nUse full multi-step reasoning as instructed.
